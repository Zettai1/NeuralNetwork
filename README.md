# NeuralNetwork

NN2.py is intended to find the value that should be assigned to a series of four numbers.
If the numbers in the first and third slot match, it is that number. If they don't, it is 0.5.
I.e. [1, 0, 1, 0] --> 1, [0, 1, 1, 0] --> 0.5, [0, 0, 0, 1] --> 0.
Currently, NN2 is functional.

NN3.py is intended to find the next number in an ordered sequence of whole numbers.
I.e. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] --> 12
Currently it has a bug where it outputs the incorrect number.
